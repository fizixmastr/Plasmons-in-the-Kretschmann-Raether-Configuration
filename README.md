Comparison of simulated and experimental results for producing plasmons using the Kretschmann-Raether configuration. This is my second individual research project completed as an assignment for the Laboratory Practice component of the Master's Degree in Photonics. This is also the first project for which I have started natively with GitHub and Jupyter Notebook. This research is a work in progress.
